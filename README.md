# Flight_Booking_System


The Flight Reservation System is a simple console-based application written in C++ that allows users to book flights, select seats, and view their ticket information. It's designed to simulate a basic flight booking system.

#Features
New Passenger Registration: New passengers can register by providing their name and phone number.
Flight Selection: Users can select a flight from a list of available flights.
Seat Reservation: Users can choose their seat from a graphical layout of available seats.
Ticket Information: After booking, users can view their ticket information, including passenger details, seat number, and flight details.

#Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
Run the executable file generated after compilation.
Follow the on-screen instructions to register as a new passenger, select a flight, and reserve a seat.

#Technologies Used
Classes: The project extensively uses classes to model entities such as passengers, flights, and seat reservations, allowing for a structured and object-oriented approach to software design.
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): Data structures such as arrays and algorithms for searching and booking seats are employed to efficiently manage flight bookings and seat reservations.
